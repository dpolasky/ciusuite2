gauss_t1_1_protein_mode,TRUE,Protein/Signal Only Mode,string,,,True;False,Whether to search and filter out noise peaks or not. In Protein only mode ('True') all peaks are assumed to be important signals and none are filtered out. In protein and noise mode ('False') both signal and noise peaks are fit to allow removal of noise peaks later. Signals/important peaks can be any analyte peak (not necessarily just protein).
gaussian_2_int_threshold,0.05,Minimum Peak Amplitude,float,0,1,,Minimum normalized intensity at peak centroid (maximum) to allow a peak to be fit. 
gaussian_4_save_diagnostics,FALSE,Save Gaussian Fits and Diagnostics,string,,,True;False,Whether to save detailed Gaussian fitting information and diagnostics (true) or not (false). Diagnostic output takes some time but provides much greater detail on fitting effectiveness. 
gaussian_5_combine_outputs,TRUE,Combine Output CSVs from all files?,string,,,True;False,If true: will save all outputs into a single .csv output file. If false: information will be saved for each individual .ciu file in a separate output .csv file. 
gaussian_51_sort_outputs_by,amplitude,Sort Outputs By,string,,,amplitude;centroid;width,Which peak parameter to use to organize output Gaussians (in saved CSV file)
gaussian_61_num_cores,8,Number of Cores for Multithreading,int,1,64,,Number of processor cores to use for multi-threaded fitting. NOTE: set to 1 to avoid multiprocessing entirely (e.g. if it is causing problems)
gaussian_71_max_prot_components,6,Max Protein Components,int,1,10,,The maximum number of protein peaks (components) to allow to be fit to the data. Higher values will result in significantly slower analysis but will generally improve fitting results.
gaussian_72_prot_peak_width,1.2,Expected Protein Peak Width,float,0.001,inf,,Expected width (FWHM) for Gaussian protein peaks.
gaussian_73_prot_width_tol,1,Protein Peak Width Tolerance,float,0.001,inf,,Tolerance Gaussian protein peak widths (FWHM)
gaussian_74_shared_area_mode,relaxed,Peak Overlap Penalty Mode,string,,,strict;relaxed;none,Method for penalizing peak overlaps. Strict mode strongly penalizes overlaps; relaxed mode penalizes significant overlaps (>~85%) but not so much that they cannot be chosen if other fits are poor; none mode does not apply any penalty for peak overlaps. See manual for further details. 
gaussian_75_baseline,FALSE,Include Baseline in Fit?,string,,,True;False,If data has a non-zero baseline (peak tails do not go all the way down to 0) use this mode to allow fitting of a single common baseline in addition to Gaussian components.
gaussian_81_min_nonprot_comps,1,Min NonProtein Components,int,0,10,,The minimum number of nonprotein peaks (components) to allow to be fit to the data. 
gaussian_82_max_nonprot_comps,5,Max NonProtein Components,int,0,10,,The maximum number of nonprotein peaks (components) to allow to be fit to the data. Higher values will result in significantly slower analysis but can improve fit quality. 
gaussian_83_nonprot_width_min,2.8,Minimum Width NonProtein,float,0.001,inf,,Minimum width (FWHM) for a peak to be classified as Non-protein rather than protein. Should be well above (at least 1-2 * tolerance greater than) protein width + tolerance for best performance. 
gaussian_9_nonprot_min_prot_amp,0.2,Minimum Amplitude for Highest Protein Peak,float,0,inf,,Minimum amplitude for scoring in data with non-protein components. If no protein peaks are above this amplitude level the fit is penalized. Prevents only non-protein components from being fit with no protein component present. 
reconstruct_1_mode,From Feature Detection,Reconstruct Gaussians From:,string,,,Load File;From Feature Detection,Whether to use Gaussians previously fit to loaded .ciu files in the table (Gaussian fitting and feature detection must have been performed already) or to load Gaussian fit information from a template file. Load File opens a filechooser to load a template file containing Gaussian information; a new .ciu object is loaded for each template file selected. From feature detection uses loaded .ciu files' Gaussian fit data. 
feature_t1_1_ciu50_mode,standard,Feature and CIU-50 Mode,string,,,standard;gaussian,Whether to use raw CIU data (standard) or fitted Gaussians (gaussian) for feature detection and CIU-50. If using gaussian mode: Gaussian fitting MUST already be done for all files selected.
feature_t2_1_min_length,5,Minimum Feature Length (steps),int,2,inf,,The minimum number of points (collision voltages) across which a feature must be present to be counted as a real feature. Decrease to catch small features present at only a few collision voltages.  NOTE: features MUST be at least two steps wide (and more steps is better). Use interpolation along the CV axis to detect features present at small numbers of steps. 
feature_t2_2_width_tol,0.75,Feature Allowed Width (drift axis units),float,0,inf,,Tolerance in drift axis units (i.e. this value is in milliseconds if the drift axis is in milliseconds) from the median apex drift time of a Feature to allow for inclusion into a feature. Higher values allow more slanted features to be detected/allowed but may result in poor fitting. Lower values result in stricter filtering to very flat features only. 
feature_t2_3_ciu50_gap_tol,0,Maximum CV Gap Length (CV steps),int,0,inf,,Maximum allowed length (in steps or bins along the CV axis) of horizontal gaps within a Feature. Larger gaps can increase robustness in noisy data but can also include spurious signals in Features.
feature_t2_4_gauss_fill_gaps,TRUE,Fill Gaps Inside Gaussian Features,string,,,True;False,Fill gaps inside Gaussian features. Filling inserts a centroid at the feature median at all gap CVs within a feature (CVs surrounded by other points in the feature that lack a centroid within the feature). Strongly recommended prior to CIU50 and Gaussian reconstruction. 
feature_t2_5_gauss_allow_nongauss,FALSE,Allow Nonprotein Peaks in Features,string,,,True;False,Allow non-protein Gaussian peaks within 2 standard deviations of feature median drift time to be added to feature in Gaussian feature detection. This can be helpful in detecting low intensity features when doing Gaussian noise removal but should otherwise be left off.
feature_t2_6_ciu50_combine_outputs,TRUE,Combine Output CSVs from all files?,string,,,True;False,If true: will save all outputs into a single .csv output file. If false: information will be saved for each individual .ciu file in a separate output .csv file. 
ciu50_t2_1_centroiding_mode,max,Spectral Centroiding mode,string,,,max;average;median,How to centroid the drift time spectrum at each collision voltage for transition fitting. Default: max value. Average and median compute the weighted average or spectral median of the DT data rather than taking the maximum value - which makes them less robust (more sensitive to noise and fluctuations in signal) but sometimes more accurate if the 50% (midpoint) value occurs very close to a collision voltage used for data collection. 
ciu50_t2_2_pad_transitions_cv,15,Transition Region Padding (CV),float,0,inf,,How far beyond the start/end of Features to include in transition region fitting in activation axis units (typically V). Increased values can improve CIU-50 accuracy but may reduce precision
ciu50_t2_3_gauss_width_adj_tol,0.5,Gaussian Feature Adjustment Width Tolerance,float,0,inf,,Similar to Feature Width Tolerance in Feature Detection. How far from apex drift time (column max value) a Gaussian feature is allowed to be and still be transitioned to. This should be less than the distance (in DT units) between the closest features fit. Used to prevent fitting to Gaussian features that never reach 100% relative intensity. 
compare_batch_1_both_dirs,FALSE,Compare in Both Directions,string,,,True;False,Whether to compare files in both directions (i.e. both file 1 - file 2 AND file 2 - file 1). Typically not necessary (default: False)
compare_1_custom_blue,None,Custom Label for File 1,anystring,,,,(Optional) Custom label for the colorbar on the side of the comparison plot. 
compare_2_custom_red,None,Custom Label for File 2,anystring,,,,(Optional) Custom label for the colorbar on the side of the comparison plot. 
compare_3_high_contrast,FALSE,High Contrast Mode,string,,,True;False,Whether to use high-contrast mode (normalizes to maximum difference rather than to 100%). Default is False but can be used to highlight smaller differences. 
compare_4_int_cutoff,0.01,Relative Intensity Cutoff,float,0,1,,Low intensity data is filtered from comparisons below this cutoff point. NOTE: changing this value WILL change the RMSD values observed - data can only be compared at the same intensity cutoff level. 
output_1_save_csv,FALSE,Save _raw.csv Files?,string,,,True;False,Whether to save text format _raw.csv files of the processed data. Default: false. Can be used to integrate with other analyses (e.g. after cropping or averaging data). 
class_t1_1_load_method,prompt,Method to Load Data,string,,,prompt;table;template,How to load data for classification. TABLE loads files from the table (in main window of CIUSuite 2). **Files MUST have class label in their name for this method** as classes are auto-detected from file names. PROMPT will present prompts to select data for each class (NOTE: not allowed for subclass mode). Files do NOT need to have class names in the file name for prompt mode. TEMPLATE opens a filechooser to select a template file (see manual for details).
class_t1_2_subclass_mode,FALSE,Use Subclasses?,string,,,True;False,Whether to enter subclasses for classification. FALSE results in standard classification mode. TRUE enables subclass mode where classes are divided into subclasses (e.g. by charge state). See manual for more details. NOTE: template input will override the setting here if the template contains subclass information.
classif_1_input_mode,All_Data,Data Mode,string,,,All_Data;Gaussian_Feat;Gaussian_Raw,Input data to use for classification. All_Data uses the entire CIU dataset (all drift time bins) for each collision voltage. Gaussian modes use only fitted Gaussian centroids data rather than the entire arrival time distribution. Gaussian_Raw uses all protein Gaussians; Gaussian_Feat uses only Gaussians matched to features in Gaussian feature detection and is generally recommended over Gaussian_Raw. 
classif_2_score_dif_tol,0.02,Cross-validation Score Tolerance,float,0,1,,Maximum difference between the highest scoring number of features and the selected peak score. Increase to favor classification schemes with fewer features and potentially lower scores; decrease to favor schemes with more features and higher scores (potentially overfitting)
classif_3_auto_featselect,automatic,Feature Selection Mode,string,,,automatic;manual,(Advanced) Manual voltage mode can be used to select which voltages/collision energies to use for classification. Default is automatic but can be overridden if desired. Automatic strongly recommended unless you know what you are doing. 
classif_4_score_mode,auc,Cross-validation Score To Use,string,,,auc;accuracy,Whether to use AUC (area under the ROC curve) or accuracy of test data from crossvalidation to determine the optimal number of features. AUC recommended in most cases as somewhat more robust. Not used in manual feature selection mode. 
classif_5_show_auc_crossval,TRUE,Show AUC on CrossVal Plot,string,,,True;False,Displays AUC (area under ROC curve) on the crossvalidation output plot if True. 
classif_6_ufs_use_error_mode,TRUE,Use Feature Error in Auto Selection,string,,,True;False,Feature scores can be sorted either by mean alone or mean minus standard deviation. Including standard deviation in the sort favors features with less variability over those with high means but also high variability. 
classif_7_max_feats_for_crossval,50,(Optional) Maximum # Voltages to use in Scheme,int,0,inf,,For large datasets (especially if interpolated) crossvalidation of large numbers of low-scoring voltages can take a long time and is unlikely to find high quality classification schemes. Use this value to cap the maximum number of voltages to consider for inclusion in a classification scheme. A value of 0 means no cap will be applied. 
classif_8_max_crossval_iterations,100,(Optional) Maximum Iterations for Cross Validation,int,0,inf,,Cross validation tests all training/test splits of each class against all other classes. This results in excessively long validation runs for large numbers of classes (e.g. 4-way classification with 10 replicates each would have 10x10x10x10 = 10000 validation runs for each feature). This value is the maximum number of randomly sampled products to use for cross validation at each feature. Reduce to improve scheme construction speed; increase to get a (slightly) improved estimation of scheme accuracy. 
classif_91_test_size,1,(Optional) Cross Validation Test Size,int,1,inf,,Test size (leaving this many datasets out of the training data) for cross validation. Default is 1. Recommended to increase if you have many replicates in each class (should be kept around 10-25% of the total number of replicates in each class). Must leave at least 2 replicates in all classes for training data. 
classif_92_standardize,TRUE,(Advanced) Standardize Data,string,,,True;False,Whether to standardize CIU data prior to classification. Recommended. See manual for details on standardization method. 
classif_93_std_all_gaussians_bool,TRUE,(Advanced) Standardize Gaussians Together,string,,,True;False,Whether to standardize Gaussian inputs across all Gaussian peaks or treat each Gaussian separately. Across all Gaussians generally recommended but individually standardizing can work well when replicates have very consistent numbers of Gaussians.
silent_clf_4_num_gauss,0,This should not ever be displayed.,int,0,inf,,This should not ever be displayed.
vendor_1_type,Waters,Which Vendor Data Type to Extract?,string,,,Agilent;Waters,Available vendor raw data formats to extract for CIU analysis are displayed here. Currently supports direct extraction for Agilent and Waters raw data.
silent_filechooser_dir,T:/Dan/Data/_Subcomplexes and CIU/Avidin/_Control,(Not Displayed),anystring,,,,Save location to allow Waters raw folder chooser to remember the last directory that was chosen. Not displayed to the user.
